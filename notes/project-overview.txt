A data set with lots of American president speeches is available here. There are
lots of interesting projects related to this data set. Some examples are shown
here:
Make a simple classifier to classify a speech as republican versus democrat.
Make a classifier for determining the president who gave the speech.
Model different topics that the speeches "talk" about over time. Interesting
relevant work can be found here.
Make a generator of speeches for republican/democrat presidents, or even for a
specific president. One potential idea for doing this is by using recurrent
neural networks, such as LSTMs.
