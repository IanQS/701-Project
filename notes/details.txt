    The Political Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks

Dataset: 
    http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/CLIP/code+data.html
    Stage 2, Steps 1

Project Idea:
    

Software:
    python, scikit learn

teammates and division of work
    NLP- portion: Anastassia
    Coding stuff: Ian
    Optimization procedures: Michael

Midterm milestone:
    have an RNN written
    have a few (more naive) supervised methods
    have an understanding of optimal procedures for RNN

Beyond the midterm:
    - generative approach to how the ideological makeup of speech has changed over
    time
    
    - how a candidate's speech patterns changes *Explore the data set suggested*
